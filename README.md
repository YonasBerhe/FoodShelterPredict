# FoodShelterPredict
Using publicly available food shelter data, we can
use and run machine learning to help food shelters
predict availability of food donations.

#Running

#Notes on Machine Learning:
The library automatically finds the best criteria to split 
on by seeing how much entropy reduction we can have by testing
every criteria (dt.build()).
